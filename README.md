# Vuera in TypeScript

This is the `vuera` lib from `akxcv` (amazing effort man!). Check it [Vuera GH](https://github.com/akxcv/vuera).

## TODO

- [ ] Fix why we get two react versions on the relative `"vuera_ts_lib": "./.."` dependency on `example`

- [ ] Cleanup `example` dependencies (there are a bunch of poluting deps due to too much testing)

- [ ] Check if Vue in react works (I am not very motivated to do it)
